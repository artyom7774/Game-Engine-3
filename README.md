## Description

**Game Engine 3** is a powerful software framework for creating 2D games and applications with intuitive visual programming. The engine provides a user-friendly node-based editor that allows game creation without writing textual code.

## Another translate versions

- [–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π](descriptions/ru.md)

## Key Features

- **Visual Programming** - Create game logic using a node system
- **Built-in Physics** - Full-fledged physics engine with collisions and object interactions
- **Animation System** - Flexible animation setup with sprite grouping
- **Graphical Rendering** - Work with sprites and textures
- **Cross-Platform Support** - Windows (stable) and Linux (beta)
- **Open Source** - Fully open-source project

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10-11**
- **4GB RAM**
- **Intel Core i3-12100 / AMD Ryzen 5 4500**
- **GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT**

## Installation

1. Visit the [official website](https://artyom7777.pythonanywhere.com/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/artyom7774/Game-Engine-3/releases/)
2. Download the program archive
3. Extract the archive to a convenient location
4. Launch **Game Engine 3.exe**

## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Project

1. Launch Game Engine 3
2. In the **File** menu, select **Create Project** or **Create from Template**
3. Configure basic project parameters in the **project.cfg** file:
   - Window size
   - Title and icon
   - Maximum FPS and TPS values
   - Fullscreen mode
   - Initial scene

### Core Components

#### Objects

- **Static Object** - Immovable objects (walls)
- **Dynamic Object** - Physics-enabled objects (player, enemies, entities)
- **Kinematic Object** - Physics-enabled objects (platforms)
- **Particle** - Particle (for creating effects)
- **Text** - Object for displaying text
- **Button** - Object with a field, text, and click event handling

#### Customizable Parameters

- Position
- Hitbox
- Object layer
- Sprite
- Mass
- Group
- Animation
- Gravity

#### Scenes

- Object placement in the game world
- Camera setup
- Interaction configuration

#### Functions (Node-Based Editor)

Editor based on connecting functional nodes
<br>
Over 80 available nodes divided into 10 categories:
- Events
- Loops
- Text
- Number operations
- Logic
- Objects
- Animation
- Miscellaneous
- Sets
- Music

#### Collision Configuration

In the **collision.cfg** file, configure interactions between different object groups by defining which objects can collide with each other.

#### Animation System

- Create animation groups
- Configure sprites for each group
- Animation parameters:
  - Loop animation
  - Playback speed
  - Autoplay on scene load

### Compilation and Execution

- Quick project launch with debug mode
- Compile project into an executable (.exe) file
- Save project or its compiled version
